Goal: Write a Python program that will output the largest value that can
    be created on a seven-segment display when each lit segment is represented
    my a matchstick. Note that the total number of matchsticks that can be uesd
    is limited and to be inputted by the user.

        * Output: 1
    * Ex 2:
        * Input: 6
        * Output: 111
    * Ex 3:
        * Input: 11
        * Output: 71111
