Goal: Write a Python program that will determine the overlap between
  2 pairs of numbers.

Relevant Information:
  * You can assume all inputs are integers
  * Ex 1:
    * Input:
      * Enter interval 1: 2 3
      * Enter interval 2: 4 5
    * Output: There is no overlap between the two intervals
  * Ex 2:
    * Input:
      * Enter interval 1: 2 6
      * Enter interval 2: 4 5
    * Output: There is an overlap of 1 units between the two intervals
