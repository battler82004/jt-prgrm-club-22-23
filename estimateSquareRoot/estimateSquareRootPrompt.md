Goal: Write a Python program that will estimate the square root of an
  inputted number via the Babylonian method.

Relevant Information:
  * The Babylonian method is as follows:
  * Set the variable 'x' to 1 with 'number' representing the number
    whose square root you are estimating
  * Set 'x' to (x + number / x) / 2, repeat this step 99 more times
  * The final 'x' value is your estimated square root
