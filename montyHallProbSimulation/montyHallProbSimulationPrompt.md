Goal: Write a Python program that will simulate the Monty Hall problem with
  100,000 runs.

Relevant Information:
  * The Monty Hall problem involves 3 doors, behind 2 are goats and
    behind the other is a car. After a game show contestant picks a
    door, the host will remove one of the doors with a goat behind it
    (they will nto remove the door that the contestant picked). The
    contestant can then choose whether to switch to the other remaining
    door or keep their choice. The problem asks whether the better choice
    is to switch or stay.
  * You should run the problem with randomized doors 100,000 times with
    and without switching and output the number of correct guesses for each method
