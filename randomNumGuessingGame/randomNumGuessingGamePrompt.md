Goal: Write a Python program that will pick a random whole number from 1
    to 100 (inclusive) before allowing the user to guess the number until
    they are correct. The program should keep track of the number of guesses
    (which will be outputted when the number is correctly guessed) and tell
    the user whether they guessed too high or too low after each guess.
