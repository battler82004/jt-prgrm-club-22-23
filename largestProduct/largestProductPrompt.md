Goal: Write a Python program that will determine and output the sub-list
    in a 2D array with the largest product. If multiple sub-lists have the
    same product, the first should be returned.

Relevant Information:
    * Ex:
      * In - [[2, 5], [-3, 6], [4, 4], [2, 3], [83, 1], [7, 1]]
      * Out - [83, 1]
