Goal: Write a Python program that uses a magic square to represent a
  tic tac toe board. Take 3 inputs for X and 3 for O and determine if
  X or O has already won. If not, determine if X has a winning move.
  If not, determine if X has a blocking move (can stop the other player
  from winning).

Relevant Information:
  * Ex 1:
    * Input:
      * Enter first X move: 6
      * Enter first O move: 9
      * Enter second X move: 1
      * Enter second O move: 7
      * Enter third X move: 5
      * Enter third O move: 8
    * Output: Play 4 to win
  * Ex 2:
    * Input:
      * Enter first X move: 6
      * Enter first O move: 1
      * Enter second X move: 5
      * Enter second O move: 8
      * Enter third X move: 4
      * Enter third O move: 3
    * Output: X has already won
  * Final possible output: Play [num] to block
