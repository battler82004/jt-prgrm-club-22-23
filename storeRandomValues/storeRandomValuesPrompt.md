Goal: Write a Python program that will store 10 of each of the 3 random
    values from the Random Values practice problem we did 2 weeks ago.

Relevant Information:
    * To generate the random values, you can look at the code in the
      "randomValues" folder on the GitHub
    * The file should be 10 random RGB values followed by the random
      strings then the multiples of 7
    * When writing to files, the value must be a string
    * Each value should be on a newline
