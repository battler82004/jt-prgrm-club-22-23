Goal: Write a Python program that will count and output the count of even
    and odd numbers in a list. You can assume lists only include integer
    numbers.

Relevant Information:
    * Ex 1:
        * numbers = [2, 7, 5, 64, 14]
        * Output: Even = 3, Odd = 2
    * Ex 2:
        * numbers = [12, 14, 95, 3]
        * Output: Even = 2, Odd = 2
