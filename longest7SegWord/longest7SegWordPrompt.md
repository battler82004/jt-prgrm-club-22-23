Goal: Write a Python program that will determine the longest word that a
    seven-segment screen can display.

Relevant Information:
    * Assume that a 7-segment display can't show G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, and
      Z but can make all other letters
    * You will need a file containing every English word, one is in the
      GitHub folder named "longest7SegWord"
